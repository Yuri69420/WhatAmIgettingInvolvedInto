ONLY basic java classes have been tested, nothing else is guaranteed to work, especially the front-end that I encountered issues to execute due to poor environement setup,
and that has only been debugged mentally.

// # 2 ///////////////////////////////////////

On my device, this project has been divided into multiple projects and packages, arrange imports accordingly (AKA TEST THIS WAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE, IT WILL NOT BE JUST GIVEN TO SUBMIT INSTANTLY)

// # 3 ///////////////////////////////////////

Any changes to the class diagram available in part1/ WILL DEFINITELY RESULT IN MAJOR CHANGES TO ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FILE OF THE PROJECT

// # 4 ///////////////////////////////////////

Current update on 6/16/2024 : 20:44 GMT+01 front is done for product display and adding product, note that the data Stored is not instances of objects, but Strings to allow diplay of 
instances of multiple classes without upcast induced data loss, need to work on a parser thaty creates instances based on the ToString format (on me dw :) )

// # 5 //////////////////////////////////////

If database management is require, please contact me so we can work on database modelisation and SQL scripts

// # 6 //////////////////////////////////////
